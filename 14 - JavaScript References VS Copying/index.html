            // Let's say we have an array

            // now here is the problem!
            // oh no - we have edited the original array too!
            // Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!

            // So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!
            // If you use slice with nothing inside of it, you're making a COPY.

            // and think we make a copy:
            const captain = person;
            captain.number = 99; // this is a reference and not a copy!

            // how do we take a copy instead?

            // Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.
